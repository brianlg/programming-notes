# argv is the "argument variable" 
# this variable holds the arguments you pass to your python script when you run it.

# this line "unpacks" argv so that, rather than holding all the arguments, it gets assigned to four variables you can work with.
# arguments are assigned in order

print "Your second variable is:", second
