## Reading Code
First - print out the code you want to understand
Second, go through printout and make note of the following:
    1. Functions and what they do.
    2. Where each variable is first given a value.
    3. Any variables with the same names in different parts of the program. These may be trouble later.
    4. Any if-statements without else clases. Are they right?
    5. Any while-loops that might not end.
    6. Finally, any parts of the code that you can't understand for whatever reason.
