# What do you know so far?
First, go back through every exercise you have done so far and write down every word and symbol (another name for “character”) that you have used. Make sure your list of symbols is complete.
Next to each word or symbol, write its name and what it does. If you can’t find a name for a sym- bol in this book, then look for it online. If you do not know what a word or symbol does, then go read about it again and try using it in some code.
