**What would I use a dictionary for?**
Use it any time you have to take one value and “look up” another value. In fact, you could call dictionaries “look up tables.”

**What would I use a list for?**
A list is for any sequence of things that need to go in order, and you only need to look them up by a numeric index.

**What if I need a dictionary, but I need it to be in order?**
Take a look at the collections.OrderedDict data structure in Python. Search for it online to find the documentation.
