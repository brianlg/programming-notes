# Classes are like Modules.
# A module is specialized dictionary that can store python code so you can get it with the . (dot) operator. 
# A class is a way to take a grouping of functions and data and place them inside a container so you can access them with the . (dot) operator

# Instead of importing a class (like you do a module), you instantiate a class.
# ex.
# thing = MyStuff()
# thing.apple()
# print thing.tangerine
#
# The first line is the "instantiate" operation, and it's a lot like calling a function.
